LITCTF 2021 Pwn Problems  
  
In contest for all problems elf and libc/ld files were provided, and Dockerfile was available upon request.  
The problems gets, printf, madlibs, lazy, and editor also provided the c file.  
  
Dockerfile template used to host all pwn is in main directory.  
All problems with provided libc used patchelf to use the intended libc as too lazy to find correct os distros.  
  
All problems have intended solution scripts except Rolling My Own 2.0/3.0 problems in their directory.  
Some contestants had easier solutions to some problems tho, particularly Crypto.  
I added a fixed file for Crypto after the contest to force the intended solution.  
Cheaptricks original intended solution did not work remotely, but the original solve script is still available.
